# StreamImprover
Chrome extension to improve user experience on specific streaming platforms. Currently focusing on Twitch.

## Completed

- mousing over various chat elements does not cause it to switch graphical states

## Upcoming features (ordered by importance)
- improved layout in theater mode, removing the obnoxious black bars and minimizing infrequently used screen elements
- Ability to drag around the "Video Stats" box
- clicking on an emote copies the name to your input, for easier meme
- clicking on chat area closes emote tray
